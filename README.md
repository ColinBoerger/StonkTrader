This is a fun website I built to track different stock ticker trends over time. There are many websites exactly like this one but this one is mine. Its open source so please feel free to copy and use for your self as long as you don't monetize it. I built it up to the point where it would work. I didn't deploy it because it really isn't a unique idea and much better sites exist. I mostly did it to challenge myself to write a website using Javascript with a backend.

This is not financial advice I just find it fun to follow what people are saying about particular stock tickers.
